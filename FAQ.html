				<h1>THE <br>DIVISION</h1>
				<h2>FAQ's</h2>
	<h3>What is The Division?</h3>
	<p>The Division is a Third-Person cover based RPG shooter and looter, that features seamless multiplayer which allows you to engage in cooperative and competitive gameplay with others as well as a robust Crafting system. Set in Midtown Manhattan, in the disastrous 	aftermath of a disease epidemic you take on the role of a self supported agent in a group known as The Division. Your mission is to work together to take control of the city back from rioters and those who are responsible for the disease. 
	</p>
	
	
	<h3>How does Leveling work in The Division?</h3>
	<p>The 3 primary Stats in The Division are Firearms, Stamina and Electronics. Firearms affects your damage with weapons, Stamina affects 	your health pool and Electronics improves the effectiveness of your Skills. You gain XP by completing Missions, killing Enemies, 	discovering new Locations, and giving citizens spare items. All Weapons and equipped Gear are gated by level, so if you’re at level six 	and you find a level-eight assault rifle, you can’t use that weapon until you level up. The Division has an initial level cap of 30. 	Once you reach level 30, the game undergoes several changes: 
	Dark Zones repopulate with all new content and challenges that are level appropriate.
	Instead of segmented zones, the entire Dark Zone is repopulated to explore from the beginning again.
	You will continue to be able to find and improve Equipment and Weapons through Crafting.
	</p>
	
	<h3>How do Weapons work in The Division?</h3>
	<p>You can equip a primary weapon, a secondary weapon and a pistol, and the Weapons in these sub-categories all have individual stats 	designed to complement different play styles, like accuracy, range, and stability. Every parameter contributes to your damage per second 	(DPS), which you can view in the Inventory menu. You can also apply Mods to weapons. Mods grant additional perks to your weapons that 	improve some of its characteristics, like accuracy, giving extra life to weapons that might not seem all that useful initially. 
	</p>
	
	<h3>How does Gear work in The Division?</h3>
	<p>The in-game equipped gear category is where you’ll find your Body Armor, Gloves, Backpacks, Knee Pads, Holsters and Masks. This gear affects your defensive and passive abilities, and can also benefit from Mods.
	</p>
	
	<h3>What is the Base of Operations in The Division?</h3>
	<p>Base of Operations in The Division is a single-player only location that is not shared with other players. It is divided into 3 wings - Security Wing, Tech Wing and Medical Wing. This is the same as how the Skill Tree divided. Unlocking access to these wings will require special rescue missions for personnel. In each wing, you are able to upgrade your Skills, Abilities, Talents and Perks belonging to that particular category. Each wing has its own currency used for upgrades, which you can earn through wing-specific missions. In the case of the medical wing, for example, every upgrade requires medical supplies. 
	<br>
	Players can do various other activities at their Base, including buying and selling weapons, obtain gear extracted from the Dark Zones, find contaminated weapons and gear in their Stash, use the Crafting Station to craft a large variety of weapons and gear and interact with key NPCs whom you have previously rescued. A special feature of the Base is the Canine Unit, which allows the player to manage the Canine unit of their Joint Task-Force Agents. 
	<br>
	The Base is also dynamic - meaning it will change its appearance in conjunction with the player's progress over time. As the 	player gets closer to stabilizing the City, the base becomes cleaner and more advanced. 
	</p>

They can be broken down into 3 categories: Security, Medical and Technology. Skills have Skill Mods that change 	what they do, and the further you progress your character, the more Skills and Skill Mods will become available through your Base of 	Operations. You may equip 2 normal skills and 1 of the Signature Skills at any time once you have unlocked the Signature Skill slot. 
	</p>
	
	<h3>What are Talents in The Division and how do they work?</h3>
	<p>
	Talents in The Division are passive Abilities that benefit the player that have varying effects such as recoil reduction when in cover 	or improved healing from a Medkit.. They can be broken down into 3 categories: Security, Medical and Technology. The further you 	progress your character, the more Talents will become available. 
	</p>
	
	<h3>What are Perks in The Division and how do they work?</h3>
	<p>

	</p>
	
	<h3>What are Dark Zones in The Division?</h3>
	<p>
	The Dark Zones are the PvP-enabled area populated with enemies and other players. The Dark Zone contains some of the better loot in the 	game. At any given time, other players can either help them get that loot, or they can try to take it from them. Choosing the latter 	means that you’ve become a Rogue Agent, and will be designated as such to other agents – who are then free to kill you without going 	rogue themselves. Killing enemies is the best way to gain experience in the Dark Zone, which has a separate leveling system for gear 	known as Dark Zone Rank. See the Dark Zones page for more detailed information on the areas where you will likely spend the bulk of your 	time playing in. 
	</p>
	
	<h3>What is Dark Zone Rank The Division and how does it work?</h3>
	<p>
	Dark Zone Rank depends solely on what you do in Dark Zones. Improving your Dark Zone Rank gains you access to better gear from Dark Zone 	vendors as well as being able to open certain Dark Zone Rank restricted containers. Players lose Dark Zone XP when they die. As such 	players can be demoted if they die too much. 
	<br>
	Inside a Safe Room within Dark Zones are special Vendor that sells Legendary Weapons. Items purchased from a Dark Zone Vendor require 	Dark Zone currency and minimum Dark Zone Rank in addition to a minimum player level. 
	</p>
	
	<h3>What are Contamination Zones in The Division?</h3>
	<p>
	Contamination Zones in The Division are severely infected areas within Dark Zones that also may be home to the best loot in the game. Going into these areas with Masks equipped is a must for survival. 
	</p>
	
	<h3>What are Missions like in The Division?</h3>
	<p>
	There are several different types of Missions available in The Division. There are main story missions which are tied to your Base of 	Operations improvements organized into Security Missions, Medical Missions, and Tech Missions. Beyond those main branches, the game also 	features Side Missions and Encounters. Certain missions have minimum level requirements. They do however, allow for the difficulty to be 	changed, which either increases or reduces the amount of experience and rewards for successful completion. Missions can be completed in 	co-op play and count for everyone in your squad provided they have all accepted the mission beforehand. 
	</p>
	
	<h3>How do Online play and Safe Rooms work in The Division?</h3>
	<p>
	In addition to the PvP and PvE enabled Dark Zones players can engage in Online matchmaking by visiting a Safe Room which behaves like a 	scaled down version of the Base of Operations. Outside of Dark Zones, Safe Rooms provide players with access to their stash, Vendors, 	and Notice Board and with Online matchmaking. From inside a Safe Room you will be able inspect other random players and invite them for 	co-op play and vice versa. They do not provide access to your Security, Medical and Tech Wings so you cannot perform upgrades associated 	with these elements in Safe Rooms. 
	<br><br>
	Inside Dark Zones, Safe Rooms are specifically for the player and their team. Upon entering a Dark Zone Safe Room, players will only be 	able to see members of their own teams. Functionally these Safe Rooms are less featured than ones outside of Dark Zones. They provide a 	restock for Ammo and Consumables and feature a special Vendor that sells Legendary Weapons. Items purchased from a Dark Zone Vendor 	require Dark Zone currency and minimum Dark Zone Rank in addition to a minimum player level. 
	<br><br>
	Squad leaders are given several special features for organizing squad play. Squad leaders may: 
	Set the Squad name.
	Set a waypoint on the map which the entire squad can see.
	Set a countdown timer on an enemy to allow precise coordination on when to attack.
	<br><br>
	Missions can be completed in co-op play and count for everyone in your squad provided they have all accepted the mission beforehand.
